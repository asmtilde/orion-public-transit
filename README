Orion Public Transit
====================

~> Foreword
After a breakdown that leaves them untethered from their old life, a lone traveler departs a mental health facility and arrives in the vast, humming city of Orion. The world feels strange, yet clearer than ever before. They soon discover they can speak with spirits; echoes of people long gone, or perhaps fragments of something else entirely.

In Orion Public Transit, play as ALEPH, or whatever name you choose, as you navigate Orion, discovering its secrets, meeting classmates, and exploring the city's depths. Your choices shape the story, leading to multiple endings and revealing the truth about your past, your present, and Orion itself.

As you ride through Orion, you'll decide what to say, where to go, and who to trust. Every line written becomes a part of your journey. Every stop could be the beginning, or end, of something meaningful.

~> Inspiration
"Orion Public Transit draws inspiration from visual novels, interactive fiction, and classic role-playing games. The goal is to create a rich, immersive experience that inspires a sense of wonder and discovery, while exploring themes of identity, memory, and the nature of reality.

This game is a love letter to the ideas, dreams, and experiences that have shaped me. It’s been years in the making, and I’m thrilled to finally bring it to life. I hope you find something in it that resonates with you, and that you enjoy the journey as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it."
