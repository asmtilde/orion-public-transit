Orion Public Transit
=====================

After joining Greater Orion University's Occcult & Alchemy Research Club,
Aleph finds are world between ours and the next, a limbo of sorts where
society's outcasts and lost souls gather, and make people's darkness,
desires, regrets, fears, and mental struggles manifest into physical forms.

Play as Aleph as you assemble a team of allies, and attempt to navigate
the oh so infinite labyrinth of Abaddon, and a twisted version of the city
of Orion, and it's unique public transit system, to find out the truth
behind the mysterious Echoes the party wields, the nature of Alchemy and it's 
tie to the mortal realm, and the truth about death, destruction, and rebirth.
