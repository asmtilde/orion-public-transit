About
=====================

What happens when 3 college friends decide to play a supposedly "not cursed" simulated tabletop rpg?
A epic adventure inside a mixed reality between the soul realm and the mortal world, where they must
use the power of their "Echoes", fragments of their personalities and past lives, to fight against
the 12 major deciples of the null god "Zero", who is simply looking for entertainment.

Play as Aleph as you explore 12 different major districts of the city, each one with its own
unique style, music and lore. Meet a cast of colorful characters, each one with their own
personalities and stories. Uncover the mysteries of the city and the true nature of Echoes,
Zero, Orion, and the world itself.

Unique Features
=====================

- Play a RPG with a mix between Pokemon and Persona mechanics, except instead of capturing monsters,
    you collect "archetypes" as your party levels up, each one with one unique skill and ability.
- Collect all 256 swords, each one with its own unique stats and abilities, requiring you to merge
    and upgrade them to get the best ones in the game.
- ...there should be only one ending... right?
- Hidden party members, secret archetypes, and multiple unique items to discover.
- Unique combat system that mixes the SMT press turn system with a unique "stance" system that
    allows you to change your party's formation and strategy on the fly.
- Time your attacks and abilities to chain combos and deal massive damage.
