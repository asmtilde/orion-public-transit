seems everyday gets a little more stressful
clicking heels to the beat, i don't wanna be hateful
but you know my eyes watering like lifes gonna be a rainfall
don't let me down, don't let me drown in this long drama ball

feel the weight coming down, don't want me to stand tall
voices loud, yelling sound, making me want to fall
shadows creep, fears grow deep, reaching for the light
fighting off the noise, keeping my goals in sight

heavy days, i'm breathing slow
hold my ground when the cold winds blow
need a break pushing through
finding strength i never knew

don't let me down, don't let me drown
in this storm thats always hanging round
keep me steady keep me strong
help me find where i belong

sometimes the silence speaks so loud
trying to stand out in the crowd
but in the quiet i'll find my way
one step closer every single day
