Premise
-------
A group of twelve college students begin playing a strange tabletop RPG (Orion Public Transit) in their dorm basement. The game traps them in its soul-coded simulation: a metaphysical transit system connecting the Twelve Stations of Existence. Each station is ruled by a god of Refraction—depraved deities embodying twisted reflections of humanity's flaws.

Each player is bound to an Echo (a psychic manifestation of their hidden self). The game becomes their survival test: defeat the twelve gods, uncover the truth of Orion's creation, and face Zero, the fallen god of Nothingness.

Act IV – Zero (Finale)
----------------------
Zero’s Revelation
- Zero appears: the erased month, the 13th disciple, the null conductor.
- Orion Public Transit was not designed—it grew out of Dreamt Revival’s alternate ending, where reality fractured and left behind this soul-system.
- Zero is both glitch and god, embodying erasure.

Final Dungeon: The Blank Line
- A featureless void, a train track with no stations.
- Party faces echoes of themselves: “what if I never lived at all?”
- Boss: Zero, shifting between blank silhouettes of all twelve gods, then pure void.

Endings
-------
- Cycle Ending (Bad/Neutral): The gods are gone, but the system remains. The party becomes new conductors, trapped in the loop.
- Zero Ending (Void): Side with Zero. Obliterate the self, the world, everything. Peace through annihilation.
- Transit Ending (Good): Defeat Zero and break the timetable. The party escapes back to reality. They awaken in the dorm basement, scarred but alive. The game box has vanished. Final note: “All tickets are one-way” echoes—they’ve brought the scars back.
- Dreamt Revival Tie-In (Secret Ending): Uncover hidden data logs across dungeons. Reveal Orion is the metastasis of Dreamt Revival’s alternate ending. Final fight: face the Dreamer, whose failure birthed Orion. Unlocks lore tie between both series.

Themes in Play
--------------
- Fear of death: Vorach + Zero arcs highlight mortality and erasure.
- Suicide: Aleph’s conflict (should he live at all?), Hana’s grief (aftermath of suicide).
- Reflection: Each god mirrors the characters’ inner torment.
- Afterlife: The game is a liminal realm, the “train station before death.”

Gameplay Loop
-------------
- Each Station = dungeon crawl (Persona/SMT style).
- Mid-boss = Echo distortion (character faces a corrupted version of themselves).
- Final boss = God of that Station.
- Post-boss = character arc resolves, Echo evolves.
- Social gameplay in the hub (Transit Terminal) deepens bonds between characters, influencing dungeon performance and endings.
