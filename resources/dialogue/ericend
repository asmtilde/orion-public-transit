The seal won’t last without an anchor. One of us must remain here to hold it. There’s no other way.

…Then it’s me.

What? No. No, Eric, no! Don’t you dare—

It has to be me, Aleph. You’ve carried me this far. You gave me a reason to keep fighting when I would’ve given up. If anyone deserves to live, it’s you.

Eric, stop. We’ll find another way. We always find another way!

Not this time. You know it. Paul knows it. And deep down… so do you.

…Eric…

Paul, say something! Tell him he’s wrong!

Paul bows his head, his voice heavy.
If I could take this from him, I would. But the seal calls for him.

No… no, no, no…

Eric steps forward, gently taking Aleph’s hands in his. His voice is quiet, but unshakable.

Aleph. You still have a future. A whole world waiting for you. Me? My journey ends here. And that’s alright… because I’ve found something worth dying for.

Don’t say that. Please don’t—

He leans in, his forehead against hers, his eyes wet with tears.

Aleph… I love you. I should’ve said it a hundred times before now. I love you. More than anything.

She gasps, clutching him desperately.

Then stay! Stay with me! Don’t you dare leave me like this—

He smiles through the tears, brushing her cheek with his thumb.

I’ll stay. Just not the way you want. When you walk into tomorrow, when you see the ocean we dreamed of… I’ll be there. With you. Always.

The seal begins to blaze with light. Paul clasps Eric’s shoulder, his voice breaking like a prayer.

May the Light carry you, brother. May it remember your name.

Eric kisses Aleph’s forehead, lingering for a moment longer than time should allow. Then he pulls away, smiling faintly.

Live, Aleph. Live for both of us.

He steps into the seal. The light swallows him whole. Zero screams, then silence — the world saved, the anchor set. The battlefield is still. Aleph falls to her knees where he stood, her hands empty, her heart hollow.

…He should be here. He should’ve seen the dawn with me.

Paul kneels beside her, his voice low, trembling.
Then we will see it for him. And carry his love where the world cannot forget.
