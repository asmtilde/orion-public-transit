…Then it shall be me.

What? Paul—no!

Don’t you start. You’ve both carried burdens heavier than anyone should. But I… I was sworn to protect. From the moment I took up this oath, I knew it might end like this.

No, no, no. Not you. Not like this. We’ll find another way!

Eric, Aleph—listen to me. This is the way. My path was never toward the future. It was toward this moment. To shield you, even at the end.

Paul, please. We’ve come this far together. Don’t tear us apart now!

Paul turns to Aleph, smiling faintly.
You gave me something I thought I’d lost forever—a family. Companionship. You reminded me I was more than a blade. And Eric… you gave me faith when I had none.

Paul…

He places a hand on each of their shoulders, firm and steady.
You both still have so much to see. So much to become. My story ends here, but yours must continue. That is how it should be.

No. I won’t let you. I can’t—

Paul chuckles softly, shaking his head.
Eric… you were always the one who wouldn’t let go. Hold Aleph instead. Protect her, when I cannot.

Eric’s hands tremble as he grips Aleph’s tightly. She is sobbing openly now.

Paul… please don’t leave us. Please…

Paul kneels, taking Aleph’s hand and pressing it to his chest. His voice is quiet, reverent.
The Light shines in you, Aleph. Carry it into tomorrow. Carry me into tomorrow. That will be enough.

He stands tall, facing the roaring glow of the seal as it begins to consume the battlefield. His voice rises, strong despite the tears in his eyes.

This is my vow. My final oath. To protect you, until my last breath… and beyond.

He looks back one last time, smiling through the pain.
Live. Both of you. That is all I ask.

Paul steps into the seal. The light swallows him. Zero is dragged into the void with him, screaming before silence takes hold. The battlefield stills. Aleph collapses against Eric, her body shaking. Eric holds her tightly, his own face streaked with tears.

…He should be here. He should’ve seen the dawn with us.

Eric whispers, clutching Aleph closer.
Then we’ll see it for him. And carry his oath where the world cannot forget.
