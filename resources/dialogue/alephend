The seal won’t last without an anchor. One of us must remain here to hold it. There’s no other way.

No. No, we’ve come too far. There has to be another path. We’ve cheated death a hundred times, we can do it again! We always find a way!

Eric… there isn’t another path. You both know it.

…Don’t. Don’t say it.

It has to be me.

No! No, no, no—don’t you dare. Don’t you dare! We’ll find another way, I swear, I’ll—

Eric.

Paul, don’t you dare say her name like that, like it’s already decided! She’s not—

Eric. Look at me.

…Aleph…

You both still have something to go back to. Families. Futures. You have lives waiting for you. But me? My journey’s been here, with you. From the beginning until now. If someone has to stay behind… it should be me.

Don’t you dare say you don’t matter. Don’t you ever say that. You’re the reason we made it this far. You’re the reason I made it this far! Without you I—

Eric, please. Show some respect to the lady.

Shut up, Paul! This isn’t noble, this isn’t fate—it’s her life!

Eric…

Aleph, don’t—please don’t—

Eric. Do you remember? The night by the river, when you swore you’d see the ocean one day? You told me you were afraid you’d never make it that far.

…Yeah. You laughed at me. Said I’d probably drown before I got there.

And then I promised I’d walk beside you until you saw it. Do you remember?

Of course I do. You kept me moving. You—

Then let me keep that promise. Let me be the reason you see it. Carry me with you, even if I’m not there. That way, I’ll always be with you.

…Aleph…

She leans forward and kisses Eric on the forehead. He trembles, eyes shut, refusing to let go of her hand.

Aleph… I… I don’t know what to say… I… I… I love you.

She smiles, tears glistening in her eyes.

I know. And that’s why I can do this.

The seal begins to blaze with light. Eric and Paul each hold one of Aleph’s hands as she steps into it. The glow rises, wrapping around her, the pull of nothingness roaring like a tide.

Aleph… please… please don’t go…

Live, Eric. Live, Paul. For me. For everything we fought for.

Her hands slip from theirs. The light swallows her. The seal slams shut, trapping Zero within. The battlefield is silent, the air heavy with the absence she leaves behind.

…She should be here. She should’ve seen the dawn with us.

Then we will see it for her. And carry her name where the world cannot forget.
