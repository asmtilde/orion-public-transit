battles in Orion Public Transit

opt has rpg battles, and ours is a unique mix of a couple:

Of course turn based combat, like classic Final Fantasy,
but theres also a full grid movement system, and each
party member has to manage their own movement, range,
and positioning.

Each battle grid is by default 32x32, but can be
customized to be larger or smaller (for battles)

Each party member has a movement stat, and a set
of actions they can take.

There is no limit to how many moves a party member
can have, however they are limited to one action
per turn.

An example of this displayed in game would be:

[ ALEPH ] "I'm ready to fight~!"
Move <--
Fight
Block
Item
Wait

---

The movement stat determines how many squares a party
member can move in a single turn, or if they can also
move diagonally. (this can be given to each party member
by equipping a ability, but this takes up your single 
ability slot)

Talking about abilities, each party member has access
to a single ability slot, which can be filled with any
ability in the game, that is compatible with them.

By discovering a new ability in game, for example by
purchasing a book that teaches the ability, or something
else, you can then equip it globally to any party member.
Even two party members can equip the same ability.

Abilties can be passive, a new attack, or something else.
Some ability examples are:

Vortex ~ This character can move diagonally without the square penalty.
Moneymad ~ All money gained from battles is increased by 20%.
