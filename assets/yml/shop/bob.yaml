Welcome:
  damn, really just walked into here like that?
  must be pretty desperate to be here.
  what the fuck did the cat drag in?
  welcome to the shop, i guess.
  don't touch anything without asking.

Buy:
  thanks for your business, i guess.
  don't expect any refunds.
  you break it, you buy it.
  have a nice day...

Sell:
  don't waste my time.
  i don't accept returns.
  final sale, no exceptions.
  fuck off.

Looking:
  that thing over there? it's not for sale.
  this one works too, but it's not cheap.
  if you want it, you'll have to pay up.
  don't act like you can afford it.
