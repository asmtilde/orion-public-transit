LIRA VANE - CHARACTER DESIGN

Support, Healer
Found collapsed in an alley in Cradle District after a strange red rain.

Design :
    Wears a long read cloak.
    Hair died silver with eyes of crimson.
    Carries glass vials

ECHO Design :
    "Elotheia"
    A humanoid figure made of blood, shifting between smoke and solid form, wears a gold neclace with a alchemical symbol for mercury.
    Gentle chimes when it moves.
    Floats beside her, like a ghost of the past.

Origin :
    Born from Lira's failed attempt to distill grief into something useful. She poured her pain and memories into herself, and Elotheia was born as a reflection of her sorrow and hope.
    Elotheia is a mirror of sorrow and strength, meant to heal emotional trauma.
