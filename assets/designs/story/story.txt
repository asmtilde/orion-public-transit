ORION PUBLIC TRANSIT  
The Rough Draft  
By: Jack Ludwig Spencer, with contributions.

---

A sterile, quiet hospital lobby. The walls are a pale off-white, tinged with the sickly hue of artificial lighting. Somewhere deep within the building, a monitor beeps steadily—metronomic, like a distant heartbeat.

The air hums faintly with the drone of medical equipment and climate control systems.  
A distant overhead speaker crackles and dies mid-sentence.

Near the exit stands a stern woman in scrubs. Her name tag reads NURSE CARTER. She's tall, composed—her spine held straight like a rule against chaos. In her hand, a clipboard, the papers crisp and sterile.

Across from her stands the protagonist.  
Unnamed.  
A well-worn duffel bag in hand.  
Their eyes scan the lobby calmly—but there's tension beneath, coiled just behind the gaze. An animal alertness. Like they’ve been trained to expect the worst.

Outside, the city of Orion rumbles like a far-off storm. Muffled and omnipresent. The ruffle of Nurse Carter’s clipboard cuts through it.

She glances up from the papers.

"Alright. Your discharge is official. Dr. Arisaka signed off with a note: 'Take it easy.'"

Her voice is clear, direct. No-nonsense.

"We don’t want another incident. So, take care of yourself, alright?"

The protagonist nods. Silent. Stoic. Eyes fixed on the glass double doors—the boundary between one world and the next. Their expression betrays something close to excitement. Or fear. Or maybe both.

Nurse Carter watches them for a moment longer, then softens—just a little.

"A new city... Orion. It’s a blank slate. Most people never get one of those. Remember what we practiced. Your mind’s a weapon—but it’s also a maze. Don’t get lost in it."

The protagonist—still unnamed—takes a slow, deep breath. The sterile scent of the hospital. The citrus of disinfectant. The faint metallic tang of anticipation.

A smile creeps onto their lips. Small. Bittersweet.

"Wouldn’t dream of it. Unless the maze leads me to the meaning of life or something."

Nurse Carter chuckles—quiet, genuine.

"Humor’s good. Keep it grounded. Your meds, your check-in schedule, all outlined here."  
She hands over the clipboard, pointing to a signature line.  
"Sign, and you're free."  

The pen trembles slightly in the protagonist’s hand. They hesitate. Then, they write a name:  
ALEPH.

Carter nods. “So you remembered it. Good.”

"Now take this seriously, Aleph. Orion’s a city of possibilities... but also predators. It’s going to test you. Don’t let your past define you. Use it—build something new."

Aleph exhales, the duffel bag shifting slightly on their shoulder.

"I will. Thank you."

"Go. And don’t come back unless it’s for a check-in."

Aleph steps toward the doors.  
Pushes.  
They swing open.

ORION

The sunlight hits them like a slap—blinding and raw. After weeks inside, the city feels *too* alive.

Car horns.  
Street chatter.  
The clatter of feet and wheels and conversation—all blending into a dissonant urban symphony. The scent of sizzling street food, laced with engine exhaust and concrete dust, fills the air.

Aleph stands on the curb like a castaway dropped on a new continent.

From their bag, they pull a crumpled map. Old. Coffee-stained. Edges frayed.

Nothing looks familiar.  
Nothing feels familiar.

"I need a place to stay. That starts with being grounded."

They spot a nearby sign—blue, stylized, a simple "O" with an arrow beneath. It reads:

ORION PUBLIC TRANSIT

A digital display ticks down the arrival of the next bus.  
They walk toward it—toward movement, toward momentum.

At the stop, a mix of people:  
– A mother soothing a fussy toddler.  
– An elderly couple holding hands in silence.  
– Teenagers arguing over music on a shared phone.

Aleph boards the bus, the hydraulic doors hissing behind them.  
Inside: cool air, flickering lights, half-filled seats.

They take a spot near the window.  
Set down the duffel bag.  
Look out.

The City Breathing

Orion stretches into the skyline. Towers like needles pierce the sky. Reflections of clouds warp on mirrored glass. Cafés spill patrons onto sidewalks. Drones zip overhead. Vendors call out prices. Dogs bark. A guitarist plays something mournful on a distant corner.

Aleph watches it all with a kind of hunger.

Each face on the street—a mystery. Each building—a possibility.

The bus lurches forward.  
Aleph’s fingers trace the map again. Still lost. Still moving.

The bus stops.

A young woman steps on. Her hair is dyed a brilliant electric blue. She wears a leather jacket patched with strange symbols. A piercing glints in her nose. Her gaze is sharp, guarded—but curious.

She sits across from Aleph. Their eyes meet.

Just for a moment.  
A nod. A spark of mutual recognition.  
Two wanderers in the same dream.

Then—

A flicker.

The Distortion

At the edge of vision—*something wrong*.

A shimmer in the air, like heat over asphalt.  
Then a shape: a translucent humanoid form, barely perceptible.  
It wavers. Gestures.

Aleph blinks. Rubs their eyes.  
Still there.

The figure mouths something—soundless, lost to the ambient hum of the city.

"...help… find… home…"

The words seem to enter Aleph’s mind, bypassing sound altogether.

Passengers remain oblivious. The driver calls out the next stop.

The apparition moves closer.  
Its eyes: hollow, aching. Its limbs: distorted.  
It reaches out.

Aleph’s instincts scream to run. But they reach out anyway.

Their fingers pass through its hand—

A jolt. Ice-cold pain.  
Aleph gasps.

Blood.  
From their palm, a sharp sting of red leaks onto the floor.

The figure shifts.  
Clarifies.  
Becomes something else.

No longer human.

It is demonic now.  
Glowing eyes.  
Twisted limbs.  
A mouth full of silence and malice.

"Thank... you..."

Then, suddenly, it strikes.

Aleph ducks. The hand misses.

Time freezes.

The bus halts in motion. Passengers lock mid-breath. Raindrops outside hang suspended. The world holds its breath.

Only Aleph and the figure remain.

"Who… are you?"

The figure smiles.  
Pained.  
Manipulative.

"A lost soul… like you. But with your blood, your body… I can be free."

Aleph’s pulse pounds in their ears. Every instinct screams this isn’t real—but it is.

The figure reaches again. Aleph stumbles back.

"You’re already part of this city. Part of us. Don’t you see it?"

Aleph growls. “No. I came to find myself. Not become you.”

The figure sneers. "You think you’re different? You're just another ghost looking for a shape to haunt."

Then—

A second voice.  
Booming. Commanding.  
Echoing from everywhere and nowhere.

"He draws near. Your defiance begins the ceremony!"

Aleph spins. No source. Just sound.

A hand—emerges from Aleph’s chest. Ethereal. Glowing.  
A mirror-image steps out.

It is Aleph, and not-Aleph.  
A reflection. A truth. A contradiction.

The booming voice calls again.

"Repeat after me. Accept yourself. Fuse the fragments. You know the words."

Aleph, heart pounding, breath short—nods.

Together, they speak:

"We are one. Bound by fate, by blood, by each other.  
I am thou, born from despair. But within me, light dawns again.  
Together, power is born."

The entity’s form fractures into shards of dark glass—then reforms, coalescing into a new shape: sleek, otherworldly, spectral, yet protective. A guardian forged from the storm of Aleph’s mind.

Above them, glowing letters burn into the air:

ECHO AWAKENED — INTERNAL DESIGNATION: VERITY

The Echo floats beside Aleph now—silent, watchful. No longer threatening.

"You gave me form, Aleph. I will give you strength."

The world unfreezes.  
The bus moves again. Passengers blink, unaware of what transpired.

The blue-haired girl stares for a moment. Her eyes narrow—like she saw something. But she says nothing.

Aleph looks at their bleeding hand, now glowing faintly. The wound is gone—but something changed.

A whisper trails in their mind:

"There are more echoes. More truths. And more of yourself to find."

Aleph exhales. Their reflection in the window now flickers—with two shadows instead of one.

"I’m not alone anymore."

"Then let the game begin."
