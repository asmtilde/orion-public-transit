don't think you know i've seen the fall
ashes in the wind, i've felt it all
don't think you get how far i'll go
from silence yeah, i rise solo

don't think you know what burns inside
a flickering flame, now watch me glide
don't need your map, I've got my sky
wings out wide, don't ask why

hey bring me down, just one more time
but I've outgrown that climb
bring me down?  nah, not today
crash and burn? still fly my way
rise again, yeah fire-born fate
smoke in my lungs but i elevate

tried to chain me, tried to doubt
but i light storms and burn right out
ash to flame, no fear, no frown
can't bring a pheonix down
