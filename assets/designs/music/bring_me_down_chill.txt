bring me down, nah not today
cars might crash but i float anyway
bring me down, yeah they try, okay
but i move with the flow, let the noise fade away

walking in the quiet, no chase
slow dreams, thoughts in outer space
no rush, no race, i'm good in my zone
the path aint straight, gonna walk it alone

he said let go let go
why fight the river when its gonna flow
were inspired, fire never tires
rest today before we climb higher

she said stay slow stay slow
dont need the world if youve got a glow
crusin through not chasing crowns
aint nothing here thats gonna bring me down

bring me down, nah you missed
peace too deep, like a mind in bliss
roll with the punches i dont even flinch
lifes got hands but i dont let it pinch

bring me down try again some day
walk away yeah come what may 

all the noise, all the fuss
just a whisper, no need to discuss
walk me forawrd, step by step
in this vibe, i find my rep

bring me down aint no crime
i rise above, yeah i take my time
bring me down zero chance
i dance through the storm, in this trance

no rush no fuss, no fight no stress
i move with the flow, just let it progress
bring me down for what, for who
i got my peace, nothing to prove
